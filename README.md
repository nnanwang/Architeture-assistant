## Run this App

### 1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
### 2. Set up your OpenAI API key
- create *OPENAI_API_KEY.js* and *TRIPO_API_KEY.js* file in the component folder
- Put your key in the file: ```export default '<Your OpenAI API Key>'```
- Put your key in the file: ```export default '<Your tripAI API Key>'```

  
### 3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
